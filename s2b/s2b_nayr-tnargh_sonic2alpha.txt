1. Introduction

Welcome to the first readme design of the Sonic 2 alpha hoax! "Why am I
making this?" you may ask.  Because I've noticed that many sites are
taking the hoax and calling it the final.  Any site who releases this
hack must include this readme, unchanged in any form.  If you know a
site that has this without this readme or changed wording, notify me so
I can notify SEGA of the illegal fiends.  I'm also making this as
something fun to read before playing the game and what to look forward
to (I had someone say it was a game with a deleted Wood Zone and
nothing else impressive).  Of course, that's what it is at the moment,
but it will be a reasonable facsimile to the final when completed.
Until then, enjoy the new changes that I've made and be patient for the
next release (which should be from 1 month at the minimum to 6 months
at the maximum).  Bye ;) !!

2. How to patch a ROM image

I've recieved countless numbers of complaints about me using a patching
system to release the hoax.  I agree it's a hassle and releasing a ROM
image would be easier, but ROM images are illegal.  Yes, that means I'm
breaking the law by hacking it.  If sega request it, I'll destroy all
traces of the patch and the game off my computer's hard drive.  Until
then, I'm not putting something illegal out for you to download.  If
any of you would like to host the ROM on your site and give me the link
to it, I will link to your site so the ROM can be obtained.  Anyway,
here's how to patch stuff using Segatool.  If there's demand, I'll
include SAX patching also (which is much more efficient than Segatool).

1. Shut down into DOS, because it's a DOS program.  Running it in
   Windows can create problems.  After all, it's not like Windows is
   meant to help you at all.

2. Go to the directory at the DOS prompt that it's in.  For example if
   the directory it's in is segatool type "cd segatool".

3. Type segatool into the DOS prompt.

4. Go to "Use IPS" and hit enter / return.

5. Choose IPS from the directory it's in on the left side of the screen

6. Now choose the game to patch it to from the proper directory.  Make
   sure the file is in *.bin form.  You can do this by going into
   Genecyst, opening up Sonic 2, and going to the following menus:

	CPU > Dump > ROM
   
   Rename the file Sonic2a.bin and then repeat the process and choose
   Sonic2a.bin as the game to patch it to.

7. Quit Segatool and run the game in Genecyst and you should have the
   hoax.  The easiest way to tell is if it appears as the beta would,
   not the final.  If it doesn't work, try again.  If it still doesn't
   work, wait for a link to the ROM.

The final goal of the hoax
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

The final goal is to make something that will give players what we've
looked for.  A playable alpha of Sonic 2.  This will be as close as I
can get, making about 5 new levels and two new level layouts.  Here's
the order that the following updates will come in:

This release:

1. Miscellaneous changes to cause normal S2B savestates to go haywire
when loading my stuff.
2. HPZ's new level layout.
3. Invisible Tails sprites (eventually tails will be gone).
4. HPZ layout finished (the level loops vertically both on the bottom
   and top of the screen!  You can make it to the end of the level!)

Release 5:(ET: 1 month)

1. HPZ's new object layout.
2. New sprites implemented.
3. Bugs fixed

This hack and all related things in it are (c) 2000 Nayr T'nargh (James
R. Grant).  All characters are (c) 1991 SEGA Enterprises.  The graphics
are copyrighted to them too theoretically, but HPZ's and WZ's are not
because they never released the graphics for those levels.  WZ's
pallete is (c) 1992 SEGA Enterprises, because it can be found in the
final.  The sprite and ring layout of HPZ is copyright SEGA and the 
name is too.  This about sums up all the stupid disclaimer stuff (it's
illegal after all, so I can only protect myself so much!).  I'm not
responsible if this harms you, your family, your pet, your right toe
nail, your computer, or anything else you can think of.  I'm not
responsible if an alien space ship lands in your yard and abducts you.
You agree to these terms by using this hack.  Thankyou!
