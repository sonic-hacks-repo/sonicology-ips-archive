# sonicology-ips-archive
A very old mirror of the sonicology (ran by Hivebrain - http://info.sonicretro.org/User:Hivebrain ) ips archive. I believe nothing on here is updated past 2002. I did a little restoration work here and there and some files are lost, but this should be mostly complete. If you are new to HTML, just simply download all the files to a folder and open the "index.html" file in your web browser and enjoy. Or you can just simply look through the folders and download the patches manually.
