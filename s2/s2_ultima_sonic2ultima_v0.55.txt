This is the Readme file for Sonic 2 Ultima v0.55b. Sonic 2 Ultima is a hack of Sonic 2 for 
Genesis/Megadrive, created by Ultima(That's me) to be enjoyed by the user(That's you).

================
WHAT IS SONIC 2?
================

If you found this file by accident, or don't happen to know what game Sonic 2 is, then I'll 
tell you here. Sonic 2 is the second in the series of Sonic the Hedgehog games(and my personal 
favorite!). It's got all of the best levels, but unfortunately it doesn't par up with Sonic 3's 
graphics or sound. What Sonic 2 is to me.... A game me and my brother used to spend 24/7 
playing when I was 7!

=======================
WHAT IS SONIC 2 ULTIMA?
=======================

Sonic 2 Ultima is a modification for Sonic 2. The Sonic 2 ROM must be in BIN format, which 
means that the file uses no particular byteswapping methods. Instead it is just the Raw ROM 
image, which is exactly what you have in the original cart. Sonic 2 Ultima is a project to 
change every level, change the level order, what certain levels look like, some of the speed 
ratios and the difficulty of the game. It is designed to start easy and get harder and harder 
until you finally reach the Death Egg, the hardest level I will ever make!

=========================
HISTORY OF SONIC 2 ULTIMA
=========================

Sonic 2 Ultima derived from - This WILL scare you - Small paper games using a cut-out Sonic 
Picture and some dice. From there it became a fully fledged(and fully trashed) MMF Fangame. It 
then went through the stages of MMF games using ACTUAL Graphics and after that I found the 
SSRG(or the SSRG might have even found me), and the REAL Sonic 2 Ultima began. That is the one 
in progress now.

========================
LATEST VERSION ADDITIONS
========================

A lot. That's all I can say. A LOT. A savestate is included to allow access to the level 
select, and I recommend you check it out. If the savestate doesn't work, the level select code 
is 01, 02, 03, 04.

ZIP THROUGH THE ZONES, AS THEY PUT IT IN THE MANUAL FOR SONIC 2
===============================================================

---------------
SUNNY HILL ZONE
---------------

It is the summer, and Sonic decides to hang out in his favorite Zone - Emerald Hill. But to 
his surprise, RObotnik has amplified the heat and made the Zone into a roasting mass of Badniks 
and Dead grass. Get vengeance on the evil doctor, in much the same way as you would had he not 
Roasted Emerald Hill!

--------------
MINE MAZE ZONE
--------------

After persuing Robotnik down into the caves of Sunny Hill, Sonic found himself falling into a 
deep pit - Leading to the Mine Maze built by the Ancients 10000 years ago. Can Sonic find all 
of the secrets?

---------------
NEO CASINO ZONE
---------------

Casino Night Zone has been remodeled into the new and improved Neo Casino Zone. But who 
happens to own it - You guessed it! - Dr Eggman himself. Crash the Casino!

-------------------
ANCIENT FOREST ZONE
-------------------

An ancient forest left in the heart of the island. This forest is said to be guarding a great 
Palace, but no one has ever seen it...

------------------
HIDDEN PALACE ZONE
------------------

Until Now! This palace is very mysterious, and even contians a huge highly powered Emerald 
inside. What could that crystal be for? Only time can tell.

--------------
OIL OCEAN ZONE
--------------

Sonic has found the hidden(or maybe not so) base of Robotnik. By pumping Oil into the sea, 
Robotnik is creating more pollution, made to spead to other areas like the Green Hill Zone 
across the ocean. Can Sonic stop him Once and For All?

-----------------
VULCAN PANIC ZONE
-----------------

Towering over the Oil Ocean base, Mount Vulcan steams and the fiery depths of this volcano 
contain a precious secret.

----------------
AUTUMN LAKE ZONE
----------------

Having found clues as to the whereabouts of Robotnik's Launch Base, Sonic follows them through 
the mystical lake where the season never changes. This lake runs deep, and you're sure to have 
to dive into the depths to find the exit.

------------------
ROBOTECH CITY ZONE
------------------

Not much is known about Robotnik's twisted Base, but what is certain is that it is huge, and 
Sonic will need every bit of wit and skill he has gained throughout the long journey here. By 
far the most complex of Robotnik's plans, but no-one knows where Eggman plans to strike next, 
could it be that he has decided to blow up his own base?

---------
SKY CHASE
---------

As Robotech City is about to self destruct, Robotnik high tails it into his Wing Fortress. 
Sonic hops onto the Tornado to give chase. Is this the final chapter in the story?

-------------
WING FORTRESS
-------------

Sonic hops on board Robotnik's Flying Fortress to find Robotnik, and finally duke it out with 
him.

--------------
DEATH EGG ZONE
--------------

Robotnik's Ultimate Weapon. You'll just have to wait and see about this one....

=======================
WHY THIS HACK WAS MADE:
=======================

This hack, and I thank you for your interest, was made for a few reasons. Firstly is I've 
always wanted to make my own levels for Sonic 2. My brother used to make levels for the Debug 
Mode in 2 Player, but it wasn't the same. Now with Emulation Technology, I can finally have my 
dream come true.

=====================================
