This is Sonic 2 Take 2! a hack of the famous(and infamous) game called Sonic 2. 

This version includes:
Lives Icon changed, "TAKE 2" written on title screen, Salus sprites halfway done, palette change for Stardust Zone.


I'd like to thank the SSC (because listing your names took too long^_^;), Yuji Naka, the designer of Gens, the designer of TLP, and my dog for helping me work on my game!
