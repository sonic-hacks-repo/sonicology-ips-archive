2.) History

V1.0 - First public release. Many bugs.
---------------------------
3.) Storyline

Sonic is still his red color and has not
yet found a way to return to his dimension.
Although he believes that he is getting
closer to a solution. He has already attempted
one major attack on Eggman but Eggman had escaped
at the last second. Now Sonic is ready for his
second attack.

4.) Characters

Sonic
Tails
Eggman
Metal Sonic
---------------------------
5.) Bugs

Currently the biggest bug is about halfway through
Emerald Hill 1. You will notice a block of scrambled
text floatng in the air. I have no idea what is
causing this and so I cannot change it. I am assuming
that I missed an Unknown Object somewhere and I am
looking for something that is cusing this to happen.

Last I checked there were a few glitches with platform
solidity. Mainly you could walkthrough some walls and
fall through some floors when you weren't supposed to.
I think I have fixed all these though.
