- A Shadow the Hedgehog Sprite hack of Sonic 2.  
- Pallets were Changed to the levels I did the most work in, (ARZ, for example.)
- Very few level layouts worked on, due to lack of a real level editor.
- Object layouts in a few areas altered.
- Mostly just a Sprite hack.  75% of Sonic and Tails were modified, 
- Super Sonic is planned next. XD
- Random things hacked, for neat features...  
- Mostly just pallets, which were found manually and edited via Hex Editor, except 
   for one or two random pallets done in SHWP.
- Level Order rearranged
- Level Order shortened to 4 stages(Cause I thought I'd at LEAST edit 4 stages for 
   the hacking contest...)
- Music edited a bit... Tempo changes, really...
- Some Random things I've completely forgotten. ^_^;;;
- Level Select code: 19, 73, 05, 19
- 14 Continues: 43, 48, 41, 4F (Hex for CHAO)
