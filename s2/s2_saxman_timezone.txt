SONIC TIMEZONES
BETA VERSION - 0.01
BUILD - 05/19/2002
=============================================================================

This is a hack for Sonic the Hedgehog 2. It's an attempt to make Sonic 2 into
an entirely new Sonic game. At the current moment, it's still pretty much the
same game, but in the future, brand new levels, art, features, etc will be
introduced. For now though, I am just setting up the game 'structure'.

This version was rushed in many areas in order to prepare it for the Sonic
ROM hacking contest that Nayr is holding. I appologize if it's not up to the
best quality that it could be. I hope that you will at least enjoy what I
have to offer for now.


FEATURES:
- Sonic CD style spindash
- Super peel-out partially working
- Time travel in EHZ and OOZ
- In process of making a level select from the options menu (not working yet)
- Press A in debug mode while paused and you it takes you to the level select
- Save game -- go to "2 player vs" to 'continue' your game (Gens recommended)
- Player icons for Sonic replaced with Sonic CD icons
- Score/Time/Rings stat art modified
- "SEGA" sound redone
- Sonic 2 beta music imported
- Replaced songs 01, 02, and 12


NOTES:
- To travel to the future, you must be playing either EHZ1 or OOZ1. Don't
  pass a starpost -- this will cause it not to work. Collect 50 rings (I made
  this very easy to do) and then pass the future post (it's invisible, but
  it's there). Then when you see the stars, jump through them. You will be
  taken to a future version of the level.
- Songs 18-2F don't work due to some compatability issues.


TOOLS USED:
- Microsoft Visual C++ 6 (hex editor)
- Sonic Sound Editor
