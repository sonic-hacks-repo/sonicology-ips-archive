Here is my first major Sonic 2 hack. I call it "Sonic 2 Megasis". It's the Sonic 1 Megasis sequel.


What you will need:

A Sega Genesis Emulator

A Sonic 2 ROM in binary format

AN IPS patcher (Segatool, Stealth Patch, SHWP,etc.)


What's been done:

Every Zone's palette has been changed.

The playlist has been modified

Hidden Palace and Wood Zone! (I don't know HOW I did that!)

New level design for Death Egg Zone! Check it out!


What is needed: 

New level layouts

Complete Hidden Palace and Wood Zone.


Tools used to make this hack:

E.S.E. (Esrael Sonic Editor)

ChaoSaX Palette Editor

SonED (I think that was how I got Hidden Palace and Wood)


Other Facts:

As for Hidden Palace and Wood,

I probably got that by fooling around with SonED a little bit. I was originally gonna do a new level design for Emerald Hill,

but I decided to save that for the next version. When I used SonED, I played the game in an emulator and saw those 2 Zones on

the level select! But as you can see, the Zones are very incomplete. I will work on them some more in the future...
