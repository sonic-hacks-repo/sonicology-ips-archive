SRILE: Sonic ROM Internal Level Editor (for Sonic 2)
BETA VERSION - 0.01
BUILD - 05/19/2002
=============================================================================

INSTALLING:
Apply SRILE.IPS to your Sonic 2 hack using any IPS patcher. Then, add the
SRILE.DAT file onto the end of the ROM. Once you do this, check out address
041C30. Here, you will find 00100000. This is the address it looks at to try
and find the information from SRILE.DAT. If needed, you can change this so
that it points to the correct location.


USAGE:
Do NOT load an existing savestate unless you made it with SRILE already
installed. Enter the game in debug mode. Now press B to change Sonic into an
object and start placing the objects you want in the desired places. When
you're done, close the emulator and take a look in the directory that you
have configured for SRAM files. You'll see one for your hack. Open it in a
hex editor. Look at address 000400. You'll see all the information logged for
the objects that you placed on the screen. Although, this is an early beta,
so unfortunately, it doesn't log the object values, but it does log the X and
Y positions. All you need to do is fill in the object values, then copy it
and paste it into the appropriate location in your hack. Make sure that you
place all objects in the correct order. Also, if you need to make an object
so that it doesn't respawn (monitors, enemies, etc), you will need to add 80h
to the upper Y value.
