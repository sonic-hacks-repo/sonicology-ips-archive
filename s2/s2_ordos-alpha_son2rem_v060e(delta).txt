			II. What Is Sonic 2 Remix?

Sonic The Hedgehog 2 Remix is a hack of Sonic The Hedgehog 2. The aim is to insert three brand spanking new zones, Dust Valley (winter/ice based zone), Cactus Plains (Dust Hill from Sonic 2 concept art) and Genocide City (based on Scrap Brain and Launch Base), along with the two zones cut from Sonic 2 Beta, Hidden Palace and Mech Forest (Wood). Several zones will have their art altered, so far Casinopolis and Death Egg are the only zones planned to have art alterations, but others may follow. New palettes and zone layouts will also be implemented along with the addition of new music tracks for the new zones (hopefully that is).
