*SONIC THE HEDGEHOG BETA HOAX*
Created by NeoSonic
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: This is NOT a real Beta ROM. It is a HOAX. It is NOT REAL.
Understand?

INSTRUCTIONS: This is not a ROM, it is an IPS patch, so you need to
apply it to an UNCHANGED Sonic 1 ROM, in binary format. If you
encounter any problems, feel free to e-mail me at PPeak@aol.com :)

*This is basically my attempt to recreate Sonic 1 Beta, using info
gathered from magazine screenshots and other sources.
Here is what has been changed:

Level Select changed so:
Scrap Brain Zone now becomes "Clockwork Zone"
Spring Yard Zone now becomes "Sparkling Zone"
Final Zone is now SBZ Act 3
...and SBZ3 Act 3 is now Labyrinth Act 4 (confused yet?)

Title screen BG is now 100% black, "Press Start Button" has been
enabled

Green Hill Zone now has a night-time background, flowers are purple
(like in the ending), and the pink rocks are now brown.

Marble Zone's palette is now blue, as opposed to purple...

Spring Yard Zone becomes "Sparkling Zone", with a night-time background.

Labyrinth Zone's background is now 100% black.

Title Cards have been disabled

Used Iceknight's cool IPS patch which causes Sonic to warp and
disappear for a few seconds (this was originally how he was
going to get to the Special Stage)

*Well, that just about wraps it up, thanks for playing! :)

*Special thanks:
*Gerbil, for Sonic Hacking Wiz Pro, the tool I used to edit the palettes
and other miscellaneous things :)
*Iceknight, for creating the "Sonic Warp" IPS patch, used in this hack.
*Hivebrain, for his cool site where I gathered most of the information
about Sonic 1 Beta to create this hack. You can visit the site at:
