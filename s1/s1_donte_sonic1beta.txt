This is my first Sonic 1 hack! It's the 4th Sonic 1 Beta Hoax Every made!


What you will need:

A Sega Genesis Emulator

An IPS Patcher (Segatool, Stealth Patch, etc.)

A Sonic 1 ROM in Binary format


What's been done:

Palettes of every Zone has been changed (Except for Star Light Zone)

Level Select text edited

Gaslight Title Cards (by Esrael)

Title Screen Palette is black (along with the "Press Start Button" message)

Warping (by IceKnight)


What is needed:

Yadrin in the Marble Zone

Caterkillar and Motor Bug in the Sparkling Zone (Spring Yard)

Better palette for Clock Work Zone (Scrap Brain)

Removal of water from Title Screen

New level layout design


Tools that I used:

ChaoSaX Palette Editor

Sonic Hacking Wiz Pro II

E.S.E. (Esrael Sonic Editor)


This hack was made by me (Donte) donte1@comcast.net


Please keep in mind that this is NOT the real Sonic 1 Beta. That's why it's called "Sonic 1 Beta Hoax".

I'm still a beginner at this stuff, so don't E-mail me saying that this hack sucks (unless you could do a better one)


That's all for now...have fun...if you can...heh heh heh!
