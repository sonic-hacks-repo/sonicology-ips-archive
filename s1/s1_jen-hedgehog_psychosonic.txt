**Psycho Sonic The Hedgehog ReadMe**

-----

Psycho Sonic was created by Jen Hedgehog (aka Jen Kitsune) in March 2002.

Psycho Sonic is a basic hack of Sonic 1 that I made using Sonic The Hedgehog Hacking Wiz Pro. 
It is a palette hack with a few other things edited as well, such as the level select text.
If you wish to make this ROM hack available to download on your Website, please email me at 
jen_hedgehog@hotmail.com to ask for permission.

To use this ROM, you need to unzip the IPS patch and patch a normal 
Sonic 1 ROM with it (you will need to use a patching program, such as SegaTool, to do so).

Psycho Sonic is a charater that I made up, so please don't use his sprite in any games without asking me.
Thanks :)
